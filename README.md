### 1st year | 2nd semester project on Polymorphism in college.

In this project I had to build a virtual store managing system.
The store had items like books, music and movies. The store had an interface for user to buy items from the store.

The store had a strict input format with <> as value identifiers.
Some formats for insertion:

##### Children book
```
<Children Book> <name of book> <num of pages> <year of publishing> <minimum age>
```

##### Reading book
```
<Reading Book> <name of book> <num of pages> <year of publishing> <Genre>
```

##### Music album
```
<Music Album> <name of album> <year of publishing>
<Song> <song name> <song length>
```
##### Movie
```
<Movie> <movie type> <movie name> <year of publishing> <additinal information according to movie type>
(Types: Sci-Fi,Thriller,Action)
```
